# Requirements
## Introduction
 This system is basically concerned with the reservation of Darshan  tickets to the piligrims who wants to visit Tirumala.

In this project the booking of darshan tickets is done with the feature of cancelling and waiting list.

In the project we are going to include entities like
Booking
Cancellation
Display reserved and waiting list piligrims.



## Research
The need of the system arise because as is the known fact that Ttirumala is one of the richest temples in th world and on an average one lakh piligims visit everyday 
 and to handle it manually is quite tough 
job. By computerizing it we will be able to overcome many of its limitations and will be able 
to handle it more efficiently. The handling of such records and data for such system is a very 
complex task if it is done manually but it can be made much easier if the system is 
computerized.

## Cost and Features

All the manual work should be converted into computerized so that the load of employees should decrease.
The data should be stored in computer rather than in register manually.
Booking can be done by sitting at your home only, no need to visit the booking counter!
