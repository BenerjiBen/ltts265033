Introduction
"Tirumala-Tirupati", the spiritual capital of Andhra Pradesh is oneof the world's richest temples and a famous piligrimage centre. 
Everyday on an average one lakh people visit this holy temple. 
But due to this pandemic, The government has restricted the darshan for a limited number and that too for onl those people who will book the tickets for darshan in advance.

The reason I chose this topic is because i am aware of some formalities and procedure for the darshan since I am from tirupati
, and I can use some basic c programming concepts to create a simple interface wheredevotees can book tickets for darshan, accomodation and donations.
